                        First, ensure your system meets the minimum requirements listed on
                        the game’s page. Make sure your graphics drivers, operating system,
                        and any necessary software (e.g., DirectX or .NET Framework) are up
                        to date. If the problem persists, try reinstalling the game or
                        running it as an administrator. For further assistance, contact us
                        at technical@lootboxstudios.com.

                        This could be due to outdated drivers or conflicting software.
                        Update your graphics card drivers and close unnecessary background
                        programs. Lowering in-game settings, such as resolution or graphical
                        effects, may also help. If the issue continues, please send us a
                        detailed description of the problem, along with your system specs,

                    <p>
                        To improve performance, try reducing the game’s graphics settings in
                        the options menu. Ensure your device isn’t running other
                        resource-intensive applications in the background. If the problem
                        persists, check if your hardware meets the recommended

                        Disable any antivirus or firewall temporarily, as they may block
